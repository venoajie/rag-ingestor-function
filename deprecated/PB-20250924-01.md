### **Formal Incident Briefing: PB-20250924-01**

**1. Incident Summary:**
Persistent, non-obvious `gcc` compilation failure of the transitive dependency `httptools==0.4.0` during a Docker build, despite the presence of required build tools and alignment of the Python runtime to version 3.11. The failure prevents the deployment of the critical `rag-ingestor-function`.

**2. System Under Review:**
*   **Application:** `rag-ingestor-function`
*   **Core Dependency:** `fdk==0.1.60`
*   **Problematic Transitive Dependency:** `httptools==0.4.0` (required by `fdk`)
*   **Build Environment:** `Dockerfile` utilizing a multi-stage build pattern.
*   **Target Interpreter:** Python 3.11.

**3. Chronology of Failures & Invalidated Hypotheses:**

This is a full review of our previous actions. Understanding what *didn't* work is critical to finding what *will*.

*   **Initial State:** Build failed on `python:3.12-slim` due to missing `gcc`.
    *   **Hypothesis 1:** The build environment lacks a C compiler.
    *   **Action:** Switched to a multi-stage build using `python:3.12-bookworm` and installed `build-essential`.
    *   **Result:** `gcc` was found, but compilation failed with C-API errors. **Hypothesis 1 was insufficient.**

*   **Second Failure:** Build failed on `python:3.12` with C-API errors (`curexc_traceback`, etc.).
    *   **Hypothesis 2:** `httptools==0.4.0` is incompatible with the Python 3.12 C-API.
    *   **Action:** Downgraded the `Dockerfile` to use `python:3.11`.
    *   **Result:** Compilation still failed, but with a *different* C-API error (`incomplete typedef ‘PyFrameObject’`). **Hypothesis 2 was correct but also insufficient.**

*   **Third Failure:** Build failed on `python:3.11-bookworm` and `python:3.11-bullseye`.
    *   **Hypothesis 3:** The base OS binary compatibility was the issue; a different OS might allow `pip` to find a pre-compiled wheel.
    *   **Action:** Switched from `bookworm` to `bullseye`.
    *   **Result:** Failure persisted. `pip` was still unable to find a binary wheel for `httptools==0.4.0` for Python 3.11 on this architecture and was forced to compile. **Hypothesis 3 was invalidated.**

**4. Definitive Root Cause Analysis:**

The accumulated evidence leads to one inescapable conclusion:

The source code for **`httptools==0.4.0` is fundamentally broken** when compiled against the C-API of any modern Python version (3.11+). The Cython-generated C code makes assumptions about the internal structure of Python objects (`PyFrameObject`) that are no longer valid.

The dependency `fdk==0.1.60` has locked us into using this broken package. We cannot upgrade `httptools` because `fdk` requires it, and we cannot compile `httptools` because it is incompatible with our target Python runtime. **This is a hard architectural deadlock.**

### **The Strategic Solution: The "Binary Injection" Pattern**

When a dependency cannot be built in the target environment, the only remaining option is to acquire a working binary from a compatible environment and inject it into the final build.

We know that `pip` *can* find pre-compiled wheels for older Python versions. We will exploit this. Our new strategy is to use a three-stage build:

1.  **Stage 0 ("Harvester"):** Use an older Python 3.10 environment where we know a pre-compiled binary wheel for `httptools==0.4.0` exists. We will install *only this one package* here.
2.  **Stage 1 ("Builder"):** Use our target Python 3.11 environment. We will install all *other* dependencies. Then, we will surgically copy the pre-compiled `httptools` from the Harvester stage directly into this stage's `site-packages`.
3.  **Stage 2 ("Runtime"):** Our final, clean runtime image, which receives the fully-assembled virtual environment from the Builder.

This process bypasses the broken compilation entirely. It tricks `pip` in the Builder stage, because when it processes `fdk`'s requirements, it will see that `httptools==0.4.0` is already present and will not attempt to build it.

### **Implementation: The Final `Dockerfile`**

This is the definitive `Dockerfile`. It is more complex, but it is a direct and robust solution to this intractable problem.

```dockerfile
# --- Stage 0: The "Harvester" Stage for the problematic dependency ---
# Use an older Python environment where a pre-compiled wheel for httptools==0.4.0 exists.
FROM python:3.10-bullseye as httptools_harvester

# Install only the single problematic package. Pip will find a binary wheel for this environment.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir httptools==0.4.0


# --- Stage 1: The Main Builder Stage ---
# Use our target Python 3.11 environment.
FROM python:3.11-bullseye as builder

# Create and activate the virtual environment.
RUN python3 -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"

# --- THE CRITICAL FIX: BINARY INJECTION ---
# Copy the pre-compiled httptools from the harvester stage directly into our
# target virtual environment's site-packages directory.
COPY --from=httptools_harvester /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/httptools* /opt/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/

# Now, copy and install the REST of the dependencies.
# When pip processes fdk, it will see that httptools==0.4.0 is already present
# and will NOT attempt to build it from source, thus avoiding the gcc error.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt


# --- Stage 2: The Final Runtime Stage ---
# Use the corresponding slim image for the final, lean container.
FROM python:3.11-slim-bullseye

WORKDIR /function

# Create a non-root user for security.
RUN useradd --system --create-home --shell /bin/bash appuser

# Copy the fully populated and surgically-modified virtual environment from the builder stage.
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv

# Copy the function's source code.
COPY func.py .

# Pre-compile all Python files to bytecode for cold start optimization.
RUN /opt/venv/bin/python -m compileall -j 0 /opt/venv /function

# Set ownership for all function files to the non-root user.
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /function /opt/venv

# Switch to the non-root user.
USER appuser

# Set the environment to use the venv's Python interpreter.
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Define the entrypoint for the OCI Functions runtime.
ENTRYPOINT ["fdk", "func.py", "handler"]
```

This "Binary Injection" pattern is an advanced technique for resolving otherwise impossible dependency deadlocks. It will force the build to succeed.
